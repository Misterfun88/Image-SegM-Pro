### Superpixel Hierarchical Clustering algorithm (SPHC)
## Method and Code for merging Superpixels created by Paul Thompson (Please credit if you use this code)
# The algorithm takes image superpixels created by the skimage SLIC function and merges neighors in order of
# color similarity (using euclidean distance).

### To use:
### 1. Change the parameters below
### 2. Change image path. This was only tested with jpg's.
### 3. Run program

imagePath = 'conan2.jpg'

#SLIC Parameters:
numSegments = 500  # How many superpixels to start with - input for SLIC function
Sigma = 4 # This parameter controls superpixel shape. Higher values make superpixels more square.

#SPHC Parameters:
segmentsToMerge = 50 # How many superpixels to merge based on color similarity
distance_limit = .6  # Limits which segments get merged based on their difference in average color
